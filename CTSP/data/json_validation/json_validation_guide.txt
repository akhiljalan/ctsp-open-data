Project Open Data has a tool for JSON validation here: https://labs.data.gov/dashboard/validate

We ran this tool for 6 cities in the Bay Area, and found that the results were identical except for dataset length. You can view these json results as the files named city_name_validate.json for each city to see for yourself. 

What all of these cities have in common is that their open data platforms are powered by Socrata. From this we conclude that while Socrata enforces a JSON metadata format for all datasets in its open data portals, they are not up to par with Project Open Data's standards. 

Here are the links we tested as a representative sample. Except for 502 bad gateway errors, other datasets on these cities'

Project Open Data was founded in the second Obama administration to provide tools for data transparency and accountability for federal agencies. Their website offers a tool for JSON validation, which examines the metadata of a file to see if it is in accordance with federal standards. We evaluated data files for 6 cities in the Bay Area, checking against the Non-Federal Scheme version 1.1. We found that none of the cities passed the test. Interestingly, the error results for these 6 cities were identical (with the exception of dataset length).
